# List Timer

<img src='assets/images/logo.png' align='right' alt='List Timer logo' width='120' height='120'>

I (<i>sometimes</i> ﾉ≧ڡ≦) do treadmill workout which consists of multiple segments (e.g. jog for 60 seconds, walk for 40 seconds and stretch for 40 seconds) so I need multiple timers at once. Unfortunately my iPhone timer app is <i>kinda baka</i> as it can't do such simple task like that (at the moment) therefore I made this simple app. And voilà!

List Timer is a timer app with list for Android and iOS built using Flutter. The main function of this app is to have multiple timers at once and read the timers out loud before it starts. For example in my treadmill workout case, I can set a <em>collection</em> of multiple <em>timers</em>: jog for 60 seconds, walk for 40 seconds and stretch for 40 seconds. When you play the collection, the app will read jog, walk after 60 seconds and stretch after 40 seconds.
